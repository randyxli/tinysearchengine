There will be no new data structures. DNODE will be used to represent both WordNodes and DocumentNodes. In the case of WordNodes, the key will be the word, depth will be the the total occurrences of the word, and data will point to a DocumentNode. In the case of DocumentNodes, data will point to nothing, depth will be the number of occurrences of the word in the document, and the key will the the URL of the document.
